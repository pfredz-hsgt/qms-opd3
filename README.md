    *   `2.LaunchDisplay.bat`: Opens the public display interface.
    *   `3.LaunchPanel.bat`: Opens the staff control panel.

## 🛠️ Operational Guide

### 1. Staff Panel (`/`)
Accessed via `http://<ip-address>:5000/`.
*   **Calling a Number**: Enter the ticket number using the on-screen keypad or your keyboard, select a counter, and click "Panggil Sekarang" (Call Now).
*   **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
    *   `0-9`: Type number.
    *   `Enter`: Submit call.
    *   `Backspace`: Clear last digit.
    *   `+` then `1-5`: **Quick Change Counter**. Press `+` to enter shortcut mode (label turns orange), then press a number (`1`-`5`) to instantly switch the selected counter.

### 2. Public Display (`/display`)
Accessed via `http://<ip-address>:5000/display`.
*   Designed for large TV screens in the waiting area.
*   Shows the current number being called and the specific counter.
*   Plays educational/promotional videos from the `static/media` folder when idle.
*   **Audio**: Click anywhere on the page to enable audio announcements.

### 3. Alternative Display (`/display2`)
Accessed via `http://<ip-address>:5000/display2`.
*   A "No-TV" version optimized for smaller screens or environments where video playback is not needed.
*   Focuses purely on the queue numbers.

### 4. Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
Accessed via `http://<ip-address>:5000/dashboard`.
*   View real-time statistics including:
    *   Total calls today.

*   **Local Test Route**: `http://<ip-address>:5000/portal`
    *   *Note: The local route is for development and testing purposes only.*
*   A mobile-friendly interface for patients to check the current calling status on their own devices.
